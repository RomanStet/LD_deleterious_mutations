Pipeline for the analysis of the linkage disequilibrium between deleterious in a population with 182 *Capsella grandiflora* individuals (data from Josephs et al., 2015) and 33 *Capsella orientalis* individuals (data from ). The list of accessions is in `Accession_SRA_Number/ID_ind`.

To run the pipeline correctly, shell scripts should be executed in the order indicated by their number. To run the scripts in `3_Mapping/` the file `picard.jar` available her needs to be added in `Picard/` and the reference genome Cr145 of *Capsella grandilfora* needs to be added in `Reference_genome/`.
